# Note that this is an unconventional controller, according to REST. Instead of the usual
# organization where slashes are a has-a relation, e.g.
#    /people/John/ponies   "John has many ponies,"
# wherein the sub-resources can themselves be changed, this resource is under a belongs-to
# relation: A member _belongs_ to a section. Those sections never change aside from their
# membership.
