  	The Madison Brass Band is Southern Wisconsinâ€™s premier brass ensemble. We are based on the British Brass Band model and use the following instruments:  cornets, flugelhorn, alto horns, english baritones, trombones, euphoniums, Eb tubas, Bb tubas, and percussion. All musicians read in the treble clef with the exception of the bass trombone. We play a variety of music including original compositions, marches, program music, orchestral transcriptions, and contest music.

  	We take pride in our members being both good musicians and good people. We enjoy playing with each other and experiencing the world of brass band music with our audiences.
