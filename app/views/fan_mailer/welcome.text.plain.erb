Hello from the Madison Brass Band!

We're excited to have you as a fan, and we'll use this e-mail address to contact you when we schedule a concert series or make a call for auditions. Don't worry; we won't e-mail unless we think you'll be interested in hearing from us.

If at any point, you wish to unsubscribe, just <%= mail_to 'e-mail us', 'webmaster@madisonbrass.com' %> and all will be taken care of!

Thanks again!
